# Duolingo-Stock-Analysis-Beta-CAPM

**Introduction**
In this project, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Duolingo's stock to assess its risk and expected return. By calculating beta, we can evaluate the stock's sensitivity to market movements. Additionally, we apply the CAPM to estimate the appropriate required return for holding Duolingo's stock.

**Data**
To conduct this analysis, we utilize historical stock price data for Duolingo, obtained from reliable financial data sources. The dataset includes daily stock prices, along with corresponding market index data.

**Calculating Beta**
We calculate the beta of Duolingo's stock by regressing its historical returns against the returns of a suitable market index. The beta value provides insights into the stock's volatility in relation to the broader market.

**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**
The CAPM allows us to estimate the expected return of Duolingo's stock based on its beta and the risk-free rate of return. By incorporating both systematic and unsystematic risk factors, the CAPM provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the stock's potential returns.

**Results**
The results of this analysis will be presented within the repository. We will provide insights into Duolingo's beta, the estimated expected return, and any other relevant findings regarding the risk and return characteristics of the stock.
